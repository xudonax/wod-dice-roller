                <p>
                    You can spend 1 point of Willpower to re-roll three or less normal dice. You can do this on any 
                    Skill or Attribute roll, including those for gifts or other special advantages. You can also
                    re-roll rage dice, unless you've rolled a Brutal outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any points of Willpower you spend in this way count as superficial damage on your Willpower, and is
                    marked as such on your Willpower track.

            <p>
                Werewolf the Apocalypse uses custom d10 dice. While you could just roll a few different normal d10 and
                convert the numbers to brutal failures, failures, successes, and critical successes you can also use
                this website to roll the dice for you!
            </p>
            <p>
                In the fields below you can enter how big your dice pool is, and how high your rage track is. Your dice
                pool size is normally the sum of how many dots you have in an attribute and a skill. However, some
                gifts require you to roll two attributes, or the amount of dots in your gift and an attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                When in doubt, ask your Story Teller or read the rules for your gift.
